#This is a challenge from FRONTEND MENTOR  WEB.

coded by me using
  - HTML, SASS, Vanilla Javascript.

##I used Grid on css to do the layout  but i struggle to make it responsive.
##The challenge in my opinion is compete it does not ask to make it responsive but want to go beyond the challenge and make it responsive.

##It has 2 designs Desktop 1440px width and Mobile 375px width.
